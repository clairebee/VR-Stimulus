Getting Started
---------------

To open Mercury Dialog, either execute "hgdlg" from the MATLAB
command-line or select "Mercury Dialog" from the Tools menu of a
Simulink model. 

To open up the Mercury Simulink library, enter "Mercury" on the MATLAB
command-line. This will bring up a small block library to support
integration of Simulink models with the Mercurial version control
system.
